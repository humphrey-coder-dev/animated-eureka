# Animated Eureka: My ML Learning Journey with Coach Grok

![Eureka Moment](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/FFD700/000000?text=Eureka!+ML+Magic) <!-- Replace with a fun GIF later -->

Welcome to my adventure in Machine Learning! Guided by my AI coach Grok (from xAI), I'm exploring concepts from basics to breakthroughs. Expect notebooks, code snippets, visualizations, and reflections.

## Goals
- Master fundamentals: Linear regression, neural nets, transformers.
- Build projects: Image classifiers, chatbots, maybe GANs for "animated" fun.
- Track progress: Weekly experiments + what I learned (and failed at!).

## Structure
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter experiments (e.g., MNIST classifier).
- `/code/`: Reusable scripts.
- `/visuals/`: Plots, animations (using Matplotlib/Plotly).
- `/logs/`: Weekly journals.

## Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/humphrey-coder-dev/animated-eureka.git`
2. Install deps: `pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib torch`
3. Run a notebook: `jupyter notebook`
